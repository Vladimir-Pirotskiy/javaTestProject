As a part of project, you need to create controller for page on picture below.
Class Author already exists and you canâ€™t change it, you just can use its
variables authorId, lastName,
firstName, phoneNumber, state.
Your future controller will use
wrapper class, with additional
variable to show if author instance
is checked or not on the page and
possibility to sort authors by Last
Name with calling one method.
Write Java code to implement this
wrapper class.
